# credit-card-offer-acceptance-ml
This repository contains the code and resources for a project titled "Credit Card Offer Acceptance using Machine Learning Techniques".
The project focuses on developing and implementing machine learning models to predict the acceptance of credit card offers by customers.
The project aims to leverage various machine learning algorithms and techniques to enhance the accuracy of credit card offer acceptance predictions.
It serves as a valuable resource for understanding and exploring the application of machine learning in the credit card industry.

## Dataset

I have utilized the dataset named "sample_ccoa.csv" which is taken from kaggle (link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlocking-credit-card-offer-acceptance-trends-in),
which comprises 18,588 instances of user information, including personal and bank details, as well as the type of reward offered to incentivize credit card acceptance.
The target column indicates whether the user accepted the credit card offer or not.

## Abstract

In this project, I applied seven fundamental machine learning algorithms to the dataset to predict credit card offer acceptance.
The algorithms used include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Neighbor, Decision Tree, SVM, XGBoost, and Na√Øve Bayes.
Additionally, we employed techniques such as Stacking, Bagging, Majority Voting, and Ensembling using Voting Classifier to enhance the prediction accuracy.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the "sample_ccoa.csv" dataset.
- Feature engineering: Code for extracting and creating relevant features from the data.
- Model training and evaluation: Implementation of seven machine learning algorithms for predicting credit card offer acceptance.
- Ensembling techniques: Code for implementing Stacking, Bagging, Majority Voting, and Voting Classifier.
